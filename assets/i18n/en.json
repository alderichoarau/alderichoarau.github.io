  "faq": {
    "title": "FAQ",
    "q1": "What types of cloud projects do you handle?",
    "a1": "I work on the design, development and deployment of cloud-native applications, cloud migration, optimization of existing infrastructures (AWS, Azure, GCP) as well as automation via CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible, etc.).",
    "q2": "How does a typical mission work with you?",
    "a2": "After an initial exchange to understand your needs, I propose a technical roadmap. Then, we move forward in clear stages: framing, implementation, testing, delivery, and skills transfer if necessary.",
    "q3": "Can you intervene in emergencies?",
    "a3": "Yes, I can quickly intervene on critical incidents or specific needs (breakdowns, deployment issues, urgent optimization). Conditions are adapted according to urgency.",
    "q4": "How do you ensure the security of my data and infrastructure?",
    "a4": "I implement cloud security best practices: fine-grained access management (IAM), data encryption, log monitoring, and DevSecOps best practices.",
    "q5": "Do you work independently or in collaboration with an internal team?",
    "a5": "Both are possible. I can work completely independently or integrate with an existing team (developers, ops, project managers) using your communication and management tools.",
    "q6": "How does billing work?",
    "a6": "I charge either fixed-price (per project) or time-spent (daily rate). A clear quote is provided before each mission, with possibility of scheduling according to progress.",
    "q7": "Is it possible to plan maintenance or follow-up after the mission?",
    "a7": "Yes, I offer support and maintenance packages to ensure stability, performance and regular updates of your cloud environments.",
    "q8": "Do you work only remotely or also on-site?",
    "a8": "I prefer remote work for more flexibility, but I can also work on-site depending on your needs and location."
